# README

This is a ruby on rails card management project for Team 9 for the course Software Engineering Languages and Tools in Fall 2020. The team members are Meghan Saak, Suchita Patel, Bhavik Patel, Bryce Jacobson, Nick Smith, and Matt Perng.

This project's goal is to create a versitle online card game service, which allows a host to invite friends to play a card game. The versatility comes where the game session does not have a specific game mode. 
Meaning the host is free to choose watever card game he or she wants to play, as you would in real life. 

Steps to use website: 
- Log in/Create account (creates your session)
- Host a game (send token to friends)
- Start the game by drawing cards, etc

Tools utlized to build this project include:
- Google Auth
- Javascript
- Capybara
- RSpec
- Postgres Database

developed over 6 weeks.
